 * Builds a full snapshot of a tree. This implementation works for any Merkle tree and stores
 * it in a database in a similar way to how a tree is stored in memory, using pointers.
 *
 * Sharing the same database between versions and trees is recommended as the trees would share
 * structure.
 *
 * Complexity:
 * N - count of non-zero nodes in tree
 * M - count of snapshots
 * H - tree height
 * Worst case space complexity: O(N * M)
 * Sibling path access: O(H) database reads
