/**
 * Checks if two objects are the same L2Block.
 *
 * Sometimes we might be comparing two L2Block instances that represent the same block but one of them might not have
 * calculated and filled its `blockHash` property (which is computed on demand). This function ensures both objects
 * are really the same L2Block.
 *
 * @param a - An object
 * @param b - Another object
 * @returns True if both a and b are the same L2Block
