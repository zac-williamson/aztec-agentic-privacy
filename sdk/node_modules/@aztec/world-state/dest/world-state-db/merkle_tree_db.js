/**
 *
 * @remarks Short explanation:
 *    The nullifier tree must be initially padded as the pre-populated 0 index prevents efficient subtree insertion.
 *    Padding with some values solves this issue.
 *
 * @remarks Thorough explanation:
 *    There needs to be an initial (0,0,0) leaf in the tree, so that when we insert the first 'proper' leaf, we can
 *    prove that any value greater than 0 doesn't exist in the tree yet. We prefill/pad the tree with "the number of
 *    leaves that are added by one block" so that the first 'proper' block can insert a full subtree.
 *
 *    Without this padding, there would be a leaf (0,0,0) at leaf index 0, making it really difficult to insert e.g.
 *    1024 leaves for the first block, because there's only neat space for 1023 leaves after 0. By padding with 1023
 *    more leaves, we can then insert the first block of 1024 leaves into indices 1024:2047.
