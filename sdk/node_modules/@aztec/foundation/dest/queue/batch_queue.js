/**
 * A queue that groups items into batches based on a group key.
 *
 * The batching algorithm is greedy, meaning that as long as consecutive items have the same group key then they will
 * be batched together. As soon as an item with a different group key is encountered, the old batch is flushed to the
 * queue and a new batch is started.
 *
 * A batch can also be flushed to the queue if:
 * - it reaches the selected batch size limit
 * - or the batch duration limit is hit (in milliseconds)
 *
 * This ensures that batches don't grow too big and that they are flushed at a minimum rate of 1 batch every interval.
 *
 * The consumer side of this queue will process batches as quickly as possible.
