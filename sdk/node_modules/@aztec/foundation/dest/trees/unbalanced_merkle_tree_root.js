/**
 * Computes the Merkle root of an unbalanced tree.
 *
 * Unlike a balanced Merkle tree, which requires the number of leaves to be a power of two, an unbalanced tree can have
 * any number of leaves.
 *
 * The tree is constructed by iteratively extracting the smallest power-of-two-sized subtrees from **right to left**.
 * For each such subtree, it computes the subtree root and then combines all subtree roots (again from right to left)
 * into a single root using the provided hash function.
 *
 * Note: We need the final tree to be as shallow as possible, to minimize the size of the sibling path required to prove
 * membership of a leaf. Therefor, the computation proceeds from right to left - smaller subtrees must always be
 * combined before being merged with a larger sibling on their left.
 *
 * For example, consider an unbalanced tree made of three subtrees of sizes 2, 4, and 8. If we combine the size-2 and
 * size-4 subtrees first (producing a subtree of depth 3), and then merge it with the size-8 subtree (also depth 3), the
 * resulting tree has a maximum depth of 4.
 *
 * But if we instead combine the size-4 and size-8 subtrees first (depth 4), and then merge with the size-2 subtree
 * (depth 1), the final tree has a depth of 5.
