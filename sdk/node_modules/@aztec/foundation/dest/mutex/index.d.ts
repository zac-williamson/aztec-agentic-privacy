/**
 * Mutex class provides a mutual exclusion mechanism for critical sections of code using a named lock.
 * The lock is acquired and released via the `lock` and `unlock` methods. Locks can be optionally pinged
 * to keep them alive when they are held for longer durations, avoiding unintended release due to timeouts.
 *
 * The underlying lock state is managed in a MutexDatabase instance which can be shared across multiple Mutex instances.
 * This allows for synchronization between different parts of an application or even across different instances of an application.
 *
 * @example
 * const mutex = new Mutex(mutexDatabase, 'myLock');
 * await mutex.lock();
 * // Critical section here
 * await mutex.unlock();
